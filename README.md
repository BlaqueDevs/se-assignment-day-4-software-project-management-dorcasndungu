Cost control prevents financial losses and ensures resources are used efficiently. Strategies include detailed budgeting, regular expense tracking, and adjusting scope based on available resources.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
- **Agile:** Flexible, iterative, great for evolving projects. However, it requires continuous collaboration and can lack clear documentation.
- **Waterfall:** Structured, predictable, good for projects with well-defined requirements. However, it is inflexible and hard to modify once started.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Regular testing, code reviews, and automated testing ensure quality. High standards prevent bugs, improve user experience, and build trust in the software.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
A well-defined scope prevents scope creep and keeps the team focused. A **WBS** breaks down tasks into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier to track progress.
